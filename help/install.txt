If you're running this script via 'ruby todo.rb',
it's much easier to simply use 't', 'task' or 'todo'.

Let us set that up for you. Simply the following command
and we'll do the rest:
	ruby todo.rb install

Adding Tasks:
-------------
You can add tasks to your To Do list by simply typing any of the
following commands:
