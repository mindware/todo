A todo text file is generated automatically every time a task is
added. Any manual entries into the .txt file are overwritten on 
every new invocation of the todo command. We don't really use
the TODO.txt for anything other than rendering.

The system keeps track of tasks using a hidden json file next
to the TODO.txt file.
